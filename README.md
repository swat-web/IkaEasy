## Adding new script
Create new file with custom name in directory `page`.

Default script template:

        if (typeof zJS == "undefined") {
            zJS = {};
        }

        if (typeof zJS.Page == "undefined") {
            zJS.Page = {};
        }

        zJS.Page.TEMPLATE_ID = {
            dont_refresh : false,

            init : function() {

            },

            refresh : function() {

            }
        };

`zJS.Page.TEMPLATE_ID` - instead `TEMPLATE_ID` - value of variable `ikariam.templateView.id` or
`ikariam.backgroundView.id`. When this variables changes - script will be executed.

And finally add this file to `manifest.json`, to the end of the long line.


## How it works
All scripts, that must be executed on pages are located in directory `page`.

Script `__common.js` executing on all pages.

All other pages call by changes values of `ikariam.templateView.id` or `ikariam.backgroundView.id`.


### How script works
Value `dont_refresh` define if script must be reinitialize when page refreshed (by ikariam).

Function `init` calling when page execute.

Function `refresh` by refreshing pages (e.g city change, or by timeout).


## Adding script
When adding (deleting, moving, renaming) script files, you must update information about it in `manifest.json`

## Adding images
When adding (deleting, moving, renaming) images in directory `image`, you must update information about it in `manifest.json`

## Adding translation

Files for internationalization are located [here](https://github.com/swat-web/IkaEasy/tree/swat/master/langs). To add a new language, create a new file in that directory. 

The language has to be referenced in the `/zJS/lng.js` file and `/manifest.json` file to be picked up.

Note: The name of the file should be the two-letters [ISO-639-1 language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

## Building and minifying

`master` is the main folder where all the file sources in readable view.
`dist` is the folder after minifying & concating. The content of this folder goes to releasing updated in chrome web store.

Use grunt to minify, concat & etc (already configured. Just use `grunt` command in the root of the project).
